# API Practices
API practices with Python. Played codes on my spare time.

1. app.py - First RestAPI for practice, basic requests such as GET, POST, DELETE
2. places.py - API practice for Google API Place Autocomplete, the task completes address with Gooogle format. CSV is required to provide input address.<br>
 e.g. Input: 1 Mueseum Street <br>
      Output: 1 Mueseum Street, Pipitea, Wellington 6011
